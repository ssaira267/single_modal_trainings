# **Gradient-Boosted Trees for Predicting Dunham Texture**

## Overview
This repository contains the Python code and datasets used in Chapter 5 of Saira Baharuddin's PhD thesis. The chapter is titled "Gradient-Boosted Trees to Predict Dunham Texture from Diverse Downhole Logging Tools." The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques, specifically gradient-boosted trees and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to predict the Dunham classification of carbonate rocks using data derived from various downhole logging tools (Formation MicroScanner image log and wireline logs).

## Chapter Abstract
Geological cores provide valuable information about carbonate rocks, but coring is often limited by time, resources, and low recovery. Borehole logs offer a continuous proxy for subsurface lithologies. Machine learning models have been used successfully to predict lithology from wireline log data, such as gradient-boosted trees and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study, I investigate the use of the VGG19 CNN model and gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost algorithm) separately for carbonate rock classification using wireline log data and Formation MicroScanner image log exclusively. I compare the performance of 3 single-modal learning methods: transfer learning on a VGG19 architecture using FMS image data, XGBoost using wireline log data, and XGBoost using the embedding of FMS data from the VGG19 model. I use two different datasets: one with standard wireline logs data and another with high-resolution wireline logs data. Both datasets include a combination of wireline logs and FMS images cropped to the depth intervals of wireline logs. I evaluate the performance based on learning curves (loss and accuracy) as well as various quantitative metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The VGG19 architecture successfully captured features from FMS images but encountered issues such as overfitting and poor model convergence. Nonetheless, transfer learning demonstrated moderate to good performance. Integrating FMS features extracted by VGG19 with XGBoost also led to overfitting, possibly due to the limited size of the dataset. Overall, the XGBoost tabular model trained using standard-resolution wireline logs has the highest test accuracy at 91%. This confirms that XGBoost performs exceptionally well with structured tabular data, and the greater number of features in the standard-resolution dataset, derived from more wireline logs, allows for better learning by the model. In conclusion, the best approach, therefore, appears to be using gradient-boosted trees on tabular data alone. The FMS data does not provide any additional benefit in this context.
